# License Comparison Chart

## SAP Business One functionality and CompuTec ProcessForce License Comparison Chart

Here, you can check which functionalities are assigned to a specific CompuTec ProcessForce user license type.

All CompuTec ProcessForce users must possess a CompuTec ProcessForce license type that is equivalent to or higher than their SAP Business One license. For instance, a user with an SAP Business One Limited Logistics license can be assigned either a CompuTec ProcessForce Limited Logistics license or a CompuTec ProcessForce Professional license.

It's not required that all SAP Business One users must have the CompuTec ProcessForce license. It's only necessary for those who use CompuTec ProcessForce functionalities.
