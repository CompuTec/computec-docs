# Overview

A Bill of Materials (BOM) details all the materials required to produce a specific product. In addition to listing components, ProcessForce enables users to define essential production elements such as Co-Products, Scrap, and Work-in-Progress (WIP) Items.

Another key feature of ProcessForce is the ability to create Revisions, allowing multiple BOM versions for a single item, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in manufacturing.
