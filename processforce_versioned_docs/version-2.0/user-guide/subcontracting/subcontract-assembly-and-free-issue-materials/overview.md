# Overview

To efficiently manage the Subcontract Assembly and Free Issue materials process, CompuTec ProcessForce utilizes the following key functions:

- **Bill of Materials (BOM)**: defines the items to be assembled, categorized as External.
- **Manufacturing Order**: manages inventory issues, receipts, external work-in-progress (WIP), and WIP variance journals.
- **Inventory Management**: allows for manual picking or backflushing of inventory.
- **Inventory Transfers**: facilitates the movement of inventory from the central warehouse to the subcontractor warehouse, linked to the Manufacturing Order.
- **Purchase Order and Goods Receipt PO**: used for services based on Non-Inventory Items, with reference to the Manufacturing Order.
- **Automatic Goods Receipt PO**: triggered when Subcontract production is booked.
- **Batch Traceability**: managed via manual picking or backflushing, following FIFO, FEFO, or FMFO methods.
- **Cost Analysis**: compares planned versus actual costs.
