# Overview

The PM Schedule functions according to predefined rules, which dictate the automatic creation of Maintenance Orders (MOs). This process is facilitated by a background JOB that continuously operates to evaluate these conditions. When the conditions are met, the JOB ensures the automated generation of MOs for the specified Maintainable Item (MI) based on the selected Maintenance Order Template.
