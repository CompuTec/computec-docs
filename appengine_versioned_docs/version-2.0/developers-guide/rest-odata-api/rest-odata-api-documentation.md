## Steps to Create Pick Order or Pick Receipt using webAPI Calls

- Create pick order or pick receipt through webAPI requires 2 steps:

        - Create an empty document by calling the end point:
                - /ProcessForce/CreatePickOrderForProductionIssue andÂ 
                - /ProcessForce/CreatePickReceiptForProductionReceipt respectively using method "POST"
        - Update the created document with necessary details using patch calling the end point:
                -  /ProcessForce/PickOrder(DocEntry) or 
                - /ProcessForce/PickReceipt(DocEntry)

- To create a pick order for an operation, users need to set operation details while creating the document. Use the following request template:

        ```java
        {"IssueType":"Operations","LineNumbers":  {"<MO DocNum>": [
                <U_LineNum of the operation from @CT_PF_MOR12 table>
            ]
        },"ManufacturingOrderDocEntries":
        [ "<MO DocNum>"]
        }
        ```
