# Overview

The Bulk Change plugin for CompuTec ProcessForce is designed to efficiently perform mass updates to the Production Process within Bills of Materials (BoMs). It enables users to quickly modify existing BoMs or create new ones based on a source BoM for a new revision.

With this tool, changes can be applied across various components, including Items, Co-products, and Scrap, as well as Routings, Operations, and Resources. Each of these elements can be replaced, added, or removed as neededâ€”streamlining the BoM management process.
