# Premium Licensing

To use CompuTec Premium, a valid license is required. This guide explains how license validation works, how to obtain a license, and how to assign it within SAP Business One.

---

## License Validation

License validation is managed by the CompuTec License Server (minimum version: 5.4.3). Users can view and manage licensing information in the Manager Premium License window, where licenses can also be assigned.

To access Licenses, navigate to:

:::info Path
Administration → Licenses → Premium License
:::

## Obtaining a Premium License

A license file is provided to customers who have paid an annual maintenance fee. The license is assigned to a specific company, granting all its users access to the add-on.

### License Eligibility

- Customers with an active annual maintenance payment receive a license file automatically.
- Customers without an active maintenance plan (or those using other CompuTec products) must request an individual license offer based on the number of users.

### How to Request a License

To obtain a license file, send the following details to the CompuTec Support Team:

- Company Name
- Premium Key (found in the Manager Premium License window – right-click, copy, and send as text, not as a screenshot)
- Major SAP Business One Version (e.g., 9.2, 9.3)

Once the request is processed, CompuTec will provide the license file.

## License Assignment

Once you have received the license file from CompuTec Support:

- Open the Manager Premium License window.
- Click Change License.
- Select the license file you received.

After assigning the license, CompuTec Premium will be activated for the designated company and its users.
