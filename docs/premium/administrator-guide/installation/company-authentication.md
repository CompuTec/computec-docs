# Company Authentication

To retrieve business partner data from external services, company authentication is required. This process ensures that the correct company details are linked to the database where CompuTec Premium is installed.

---

## Authentication Process

Customers must submit a support ticket via the CompuTec Support Portal with the following details:

- Full Company Name (as assigned to the database where Premium is installed)
- NIP (Numer Identyfikacji Podatkowej â€“ Taxpayer Identification Number)

**For Multiple Databases**:

- If a customer operates on multiple databases, with each assigned to a different legal entity, they must provide the name and NIP for each entity separately.
- Once authentication is completed, external service integration for business partner data retrieval will be enabled.
