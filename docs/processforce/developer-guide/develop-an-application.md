# Develop an Application

The CompuTec AppEngine Framework provides a flexible foundation for extending ProcessForce with custom functionality. Using its Plugin Mechanism, developers can build:

- Background services for automated tasks and scheduled operations.
- Web applications that integrate seamlessly with ProcessForce.
- SAP UI applications to enhance user experience within SAP Business One.

This framework ensures that extensions are consistent, scalable, and maintainable while still allowing developers to adapt CompuTec ProcessForce to specific business needs.

For step-by-step guidance, best practices, and examples, please refer to the official documentation on [Developing Plugins](https://learn.computec.one/docs/appengine/developers-guide/basic-and-business-logic/plugin-types/overview/).
