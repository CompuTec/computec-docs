# Overview

The purpose of CompuTec Bulk Change Plugin is to swiftly mass change Production Process on Bill of Materials (BoM) created by CompuTec ProcessForce. The plugin allows to edit already existing BoMs, as well as creating new ones based on source BoMs for a new Revision. The changes can be related to Items, Coproducts or Scraps, along with Routings, Operations and Resources. Each of these elements can be replaced, add or removed.
