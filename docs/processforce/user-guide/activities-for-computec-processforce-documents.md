# Activities for CompuTec ProcessForce Documents

SAP Business One Activities provide a powerful tool to manage interactions and tasks related to various business processes. These activities allow users to record and track interactions with business partners, such as meetings, phone calls, or follow-up tasks. By integrating activities with CompuTec ProcessForce documents, businesses can streamline their workflows and ensure efficient tracking of critical processes, such as Manufacturing Orders, Complaints, Quality Control tests, and more. This integration helps businesses improve communication, increase accountability, and maintain clear documentation of all relevant actions.

## Manufacturing Orders

Manufacturing Orders (MOs) are instructions to produce a specific product in a set quantity and timeframe. In CompuTec ProcessForce, you can link activities to each MO to keep track of progress, important details, and related business partners. This makes it easier to monitor production, stay organized, and ensure everything is documented correctly, helping your team work more efficiently.

### Create an Activity

To create an activity for a manufacturing order:

1. Select the Create Activity option from the menu.

## Quality Control

Quality Control (QC) is a crucial process in ensuring that materials, products, and processes meet the required standards and specifications. By capturing QC test results and linking them to relevant documents or business partners, the system helps maintain traceability, reduce errors, and support compliance with internal and external quality standards.

### QC test with no BP Code

- This option is available within the documentâ€™s tables, rather than the header as in other document types.
- The Quality Control Test document type and document number are automatically copied into the Linked Documents tab.

### QC test with BP Code

- As with other documents, follow the same process to create an Activity.
- If the QC test includes a BP Code (e.g., a test for Goods Receipt PO), the BP Code will be automatically copied into the Activity form.
