# Costing Price Determination

Accurate costing price determination is crucial for production costing and inventory valuation. This guide highlights how methods like Standard, Moving Average, FIFO, and Serial Number/Batch impact cost calculations for Final Goods, Co-Products, Scrap, and back-flush operations.

The table below summarizes each method's behavior and cost update processes.
