# CoProduct and Scrap Costing

In manufacturing processes, efficient cost management is essential for tracking production and waste. Co-Product and Scrap Costing play a vital role in accurately allocating costs to materials, ensuring precise financial and operational reporting.

## Scrap

To account for Scrap materials, create an Item Costing record specifically for the Scrap material item. This record helps allocate costs associated with waste material generated during production.

## CoProduct

Costing for Co-Products follows the same principles as Scrap Costing. The process involves defining the appropriate Item Costing records and assigning cost allocations proportionally to ensure all materials are accurately accounted for.

## Cost Allocation

Proper cost allocation is critical for both Scrap and Co-Products. This ensures that costs are distributed appropriately based on production outputs and waste generation.
