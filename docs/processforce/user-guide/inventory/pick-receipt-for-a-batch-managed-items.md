# Pick Receipt for a Batch Managed Items

Managing batch-controlled inventory is crucial for industries requiring traceability and precision in stock management. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to perform a Pick Receipt for items managed by batches in a manufacturing environment. This ensures accurate tracking of inventory and enhances operational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

### Item Master Data

To proceed, ensure that the item is managed by batches. Navigate to:

:::info Path
    Inventory > Item Master Data
:::

![Pick Receipt for a Batch Managed Items](./media/pick-receipt-for-a-batch-managed-items/item-master-data.png)

### Item Details

For this example we will set up a Batch Template that contains date and counter.

:::info Path
    Inventory > Item Details
:::

## Scenario no. 1

- Create a Pick Receipt using the context menu option on a Manufacturing Order:

    ![Pick Receipt for a Batch Managed Items](./media/pick-receipt-for-a-batch-managed-items/receipt-from-production.png)

- Set the picked quantity, click "update", and choose Production Goods Receipt from the context menu. A batch number is generated automatically and can be verified in the Batch Number Transaction Report.

- Open the created Goods Receipt from Manufacturing Order under the Documents tab:

    ![Pick Receipt for a Batch Managed Items](./media/pick-receipt-for-a-batch-managed-items/open-goods-receipt.png)

- View the Batch Number Transaction Report to verify the generated batch number based on the Batch Template for the picked quantity.(5 in this example):

## Scenario no. 2

- Create a Pick Receipt using the context menu option on a Manufacturing Order:

    ![Pick Receipt for a Batch Managed Items (on a Manufacturing Order)](./media/pick-receipt-for-a-batch-managed-items/receipt-from-production-01.png)

- Set the Quantity to 6. Pressing "Ctrl+Tab" in Picked Quantity field leads to Pick Receipt Batches - setup form (you can also reach the option by choosing Batch/Serial Numbers from a row's context menu â€“ right-click on a first column):

    ![Pick Receipt for a Batch Managed Items](./media/pick-receipt-for-a-batch-managed-items/ctrl-tab.png)

- Here, we can either check generated Batch number or allocate receipt goods into different batches:

    ![Pick Receipt for a Batch Managed Items](./media/pick-receipt-for-a-batch-managed-items/pick-receipt-batches-quantity-divided.png)

- Generate a Production Goods Receipt using the Pick Receipt context menu option.

    ![Pick Receipt for a Batch Managed Itemst](./media/pick-receipt-for-a-batch-managed-items/scenario2-productiongoodsreceipt.png)

- Open the created Goods Receipt from the Manufacturing Order under the Documents tab.

    ![Pick Receipt for a Batch Managed Items](./media/pick-receipt-for-a-batch-managed-items/scenario2-goodsreceipt.png)

- Select the Batch Number Transactions Report from the Goods Receipt context menu to verify the batch allocations.

    As observed, the batches allocated in the Pick Receipt Batches setup were successfully recorded in the Production Goods Receipt.
