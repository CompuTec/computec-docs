# Batch Controlled Items

Effective batch management ensures accurate inventory tracking and optimized stock movement in a warehouse. In this guide, we explore two key methods for picking batch-controlled items: Manual Picking and Auto Select Picking.

## Manual Picking

With manual picking, users can enter the required quantity and press the right arrow. The system then assigns bin allocation automatically, following predefined bin allocation rules.

## Auto Select Picking

The Auto Select function streamlines batch picking by automatically allocating stock based on batch allocation rules such as FIFO (First In, First Out), FEFO (First Expired, First Out), and FMFO (First Manufactured, First Out). When a user selects Auto Select, the system determines the required quantity and assigns the appropriate bin allocation accordingly.

However, if the Manual Issue Behavior setting in General Settings is configured to Display, the Auto Select function will not pick the batch, requiring users to manually confirm batch selection.
