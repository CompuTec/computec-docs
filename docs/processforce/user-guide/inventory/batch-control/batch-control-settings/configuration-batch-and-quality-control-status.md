# Configuration Batch and Quality Control Status

Managing batch and quality control status is crucial in SAP to ensure accurate tracking and compliance across various receipt documents. The configuration allows businesses to define default Batch and Quality Control (QC) statuses during the receipt process, improving efficiency and consistency. While batch statuses impact inventory and operations, QC statuses provide additional insights for informational purposes.

## SAP Receipt Documents

The batch and QC status settings affect the following document types:

- Goods Receipt PO
- Goods Receipt
- Inventory Counting
- A/R Invoice
- A/R Credit Memo
- Reverse Invoice

A default Batch and Quality Status can be defined for the batch during the Receipt process.

The Quality Control status provides additional details to record the quality status of the batch, and is usedÂ for information purposes.
