## How-to: View Batch Quantities by Warehouse

1. Open the **Batch Master Data** form.
2. Navigate to the **Batch Inventory** tab.
3. Review the batchâ€™s inventory distribution across warehouses.

You can check Allocated, Available and Existing quantities in each location where the Batch is stored.

- **Existing Quantity**: Sum of all quantities of an Item across all warehouses.
- **Allocated Quantity**: Sum of all quantities of an Item that has already been used in sales and inventory documents.
- **Available Quantity**: Sum of all quantities that is available to be used. Existing Quantity - Allocated Quantity = Available Quantity.
