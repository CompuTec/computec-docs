# Preallocation of a Batch Number

In manufacturing and inventory management, batch number preallocation ensures accurate tracking and efficient production processes. This feature allows batch numbers to be assigned either at the creation of a manufacturing order or when its status changes, improving traceability and control over production.

---

## Configuration

- This is a general setting; therefore,  meaning all batch-traced items in production will follow this rule.
- Create a batch template using theÂ [Batch Template Definition](../../item-details/batch-serial-template-definition.md).
- Enable the Batch Number generated at the MOR checkbox and select an option: If a status-based option is selected, the batch number will be generated upon a status change or when creating a Manufacturing Order (MO) with that status.

:::caution
    When the Batch Number generated at the MOR option is enabled, the Classification and MOR Number options in a Batch Template cannot be used.

## Manufacturing Order

Once the batch number is allocated, it can be viewed under the Others tab.

:::note
    If you search for the batch number within the additional batch details, no record will appear, as the record has not updated the Additional Batch Details object.

## Receipt from Production

The batch number assigned to the manufacturing order will be used in the production transaction receipt.

When multiple receipts are performed for the same production order, the same batch number will be reused, ensuring consistency.

Batch number preallocation helps streamline manufacturing operations by ensuring accurate batch assignment and traceability. Proper configuration of this setting reduces errors, enhances inventory control, and improves production efficiency.
