# Document Numbering

This function sets an automatic number to a newly created document. The default document series begins with 1, but it can be set to any other starting number. Each newly created document automatically receives the next number in the series. Document Numbering is a standard feature in SAP Business One that also covers ProcessForce documents.

Multiple document numbering series for a transaction can be defined by double-clicking on the first column of a specific document type, e.g., Complaint.

![New Series](./media/document-numbering/adding-new-series.webp)

To add a new series for a specific document type, in the form, right-click on the first column on the first row and choose 'Add Row'. Then set the first number of a series.

A specific series can be selected for a particular document during its creation, which automatically fills the document number field with the next predefined number in that series.
