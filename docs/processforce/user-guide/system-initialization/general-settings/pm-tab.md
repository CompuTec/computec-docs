# Plant Maintenance tab

The PM tab in ProcessForce focuses on configuring essential parameters that support efficient Plant Maintenance (PM) operations. It enables you to enforce classification rules and standardize maintenance-related data, ensuring consistency across maintenance orders, equipment categories and service tracking. These configurations play a critical role in structuring preventive and corrective maintenance activities, optimizing spare parts usage and improving overall asset reliability.

To access the PM tab:

## Setting Description

**Force Class Code if Category is selected**: When this checkbox is enabled, the system will enforce the assignment of a Class Code whenever a Category is selected for a maintenance object.
This ensures consistency in classification and can help standardize data across equipment and maintenance records.
