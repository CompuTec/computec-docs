# Overview

The General Settings window serves as the central hub for key configuration options that govern how the system behaves across various functional areas. This is where most of the critical parameters are placed, allowing users to control core aspects of manufacturing, quality, costing, logistics, compliance, and more - all from a single, organized location.

By structuring the settings across dedicated tabs, CompuTec ProcessForce makes it easier for administrators and power users to manage operations efficiently and align the system with business requirements. Whether you're setting up production defaults, defining test protocols, or configuring compliance rules, this window is the starting point for establishing system-wide consistency.

These settings act as the foundation for how different modules within CompuTec ProcessForce interact and function, offering flexibility while maintaining control.
