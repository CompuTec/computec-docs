# Disabling Debug Mode

Debug mode helps you collect detailed information for troubleshooting when you notice inconsistencies in scenario results. Debug mode provides a way to capture detailed information, making it easier for support teams to analyze and resolve problems. By enabling debug mode, users can extract relevant data and attach it to a support ticket for troubleshooting. This guide shows how to enable, use, and disable debug mode effectively.

If you suspect that the scenario results are incorrect, please report the issue by submitting a ticket to [CompuTec Support](https://support.computec.pl). When documenting tickets, be sure to use debug mode.
