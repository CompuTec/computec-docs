# Allergen

For companies handling products that may contain common allergens, such as nuts, it is crucial to have a dedicated mechanism for associating allergen information with items. This is essential for ensuring consumer safety and mitigating the risk of product recalls. Allergens can be defined and assigned to a specific Master Data (Ingredient or Item Ingredient).

This form allows users to define a valid list of Allergens that can be traced within their products and materials.

This data is used within the [Ingredient Master Data](../ingredient-master-data.md) and [Item Ingredient Master Data](../ingredient-master-data.md) forms.
