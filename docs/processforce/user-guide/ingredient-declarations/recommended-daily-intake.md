# Recommended Daily Intake

The **Recommended Daily Intake (RDI)** form allows you to define a list of nutrients that serve as the basis for calculating daily intake values. These values are essential for generating accurate product labeling and ensuring compliance with health and regulatory standards. This form helps manage the nutritional data used in product formulations and labeling processes, ensuring compliance with health and regulatory standards.

Use this form to define the list of [nutrients](./nutrient-master-data.md) that will be referenced when calculating RDI values for labeling purposes.

The data maintained here is utilized in the [Item Ingredient Master Data](./item-ingredient-master-data.md) form, under the **Nutrient** tab. Nutrient values defined in the RDI form help determine appropriate daily intake amounts across various product formulations.
