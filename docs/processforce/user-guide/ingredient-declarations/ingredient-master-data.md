# Ingredient Master Data

In many cases, an ingredient also serves as an item within a product's Bill of Materials. For instance, in the production of fruit and nut chocolate bars, ingredients such as cocoa, milk, raisins, hazelnuts, and peanuts are treated as specific items. This approach provides users with the flexibility to define an item along with its detailed ingredient data.

The Ingredient Master Data form enables users to define and manage detailed ingredient information, which extends the product Master Data by including necessary details for declarations and ingredient listings required on product labels.

This form allows the user to define and modify information on ingredients used in products, their attributes, and related compliance details.
