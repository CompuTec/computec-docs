# WIP Items tab

The WIP Items tab (Work in Process Items) in ProcessForce provides insights into the Phantom Items used in a specific Bill of Materials (BOM) or Manufacturing Order (MO). This tab helps manufacturers track intermediate products and their relationships with the parent product, ensuring accurate material usage and calculations.

To access WIP Items, navigate to:

:::info Path
    Production → Bill of Materials → Bill of Materials → WIP Items

    Production → Manufacturing Order → Manufacturing Order WIP Items
:::

WIP Item tab (Work in Process Item) in ProcessForce shows what [Phantom Items](../bill-of-materials/multi-level-bill-of-materials/phantom-item.md) were used on a specific Bill of Materials / Manufacturing Order.

You can also:

- Define a factor and description. This factor is used as a variable to change the quantity.
- Enter a Quantity of the intermediate product in relation to the parent product: the result is a calculated value of the intermediate product and parent quantity relationship based on the defined [Formula](../formula.md).
- Use the default Formula (as defined on the General Settings → ProcessForce tab) or change the expression format to calculate the Coproduct quantity (result). See [Formula](../formula.md) for additional information.
