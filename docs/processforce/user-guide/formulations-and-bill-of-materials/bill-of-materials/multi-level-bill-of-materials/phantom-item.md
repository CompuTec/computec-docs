# Phantom Item

A **Phantom Item** is a Bill of Materials (BOM) template that forms part of another BOM but is not treated as an inventory item.

- It is never received into a warehouse.  
- It does not generate inventory or financial transactions.  
- It acts as a **marker** in the master BOM, expanding its components and operations directly into a Manufacturing Order (MO).  

Phantom Items are commonly used as an alternative to semi-finished products.

- With semi-finished products, each child BOM requires its own Manufacturing Order.
- With Phantom Items, no additional MO is created‚Äîthe phantom BOM simply **explodes** into the parent MO.

### Setting up a Phantom Item

:::info Path
    Inventory ‚Üí Item Master Data ‚Üí Production Data tab
:::

![General](./media/phantom-item/phantom-item-general.webp)

To use a specific Item as Phantom, be sure to check the following settings:

- ‚úÖ Check **Phantom Item**.  
- ‚ùå Uncheck **Inventory**, **Sales**, and **Purchase Item**.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Set **Issue Method** = *Backflush*.  
- üö´ Phantom Items cannot be managed by **Batches or Serials** (General tab).

### Example: Beverage Production

For **Product-A** (finished beverage), the BOM includes:

- **Packaging materials** (Bottle-01, Label-01, Top-01) ‚Üí inventory items.
- **Recipe-01** ‚Üí Phantom Item (formulation of the drink).  

When an MO for Product-A is created:

- Packaging items are drawn from stock.  
- Recipe-01 expands inline: all of its components and operations are added directly to the MO.  
- No separate MO is required for Recipe-01.  

    ![Manufacturing Order](./media/phantom-item/phantom-item-manufacturing-order.webp)

To review expanded phantoms in an MO, check the **WIP Items tab**:

![WIP Item](./media/phantom-item/phantom-item-WIP-tab.webp)

If you add a Phantom manually to an MO, the system prompts you to confirm expansion before the document is added.

### Bind Phantom Header Qty

The **Bind Phantom Header Qty** option ensures that a phantom‚Äôs header quantity scales automatically with the parent BOM quantity.  

- **Enabled** ‚Üí The phantom header quantity is always tied to the parent‚Äôs order quantity.  
- **Disabled** ‚Üí The phantom header quantity can be edited independently (manual control).  

This setting helps keep BOM proportions consistent and reduces errors when scaling production orders.  

---

A **Material Phantom** is a hybrid between a Phantom Item and a standard inventory item.

- It can be stocked, sold, or purchased like a normal item.
- It can also expand into its BOM within a parent MO, avoiding the need for a separate linked MO.  

### Example: Car Manufacturing

- The **Engine** is defined as a Material Phantom in the car‚Äôs BOM.  
- During car production, the engine‚Äôs BOM expands inline without needing its own MO.  
- However, the company may also produce and sell engines separately‚Äîthis is supported since it is a stock item.

### Setting up a Material Phantom

Material Phantom option can be set up for specific revisions in Item Details. To do so, navigate to:

:::info
    Inventory ‚Üí Item Details ‚Üí Revisions tab
:::

![Material Phantom](./media/phantom-item/material-phantom.webp)

Enable **Material Phantom** for the revision.

---

### Usage

- Add the Material Phantom to an MO.  
- Right-click to **explode** it into components.  
- If not exploded, the system prompts:  
  *‚ÄúThere are phantoms. All phantoms will expand automatically. Do you want to continue?‚Äù*  
- The MO cannot be finalized until all phantoms are expanded.  

:::tip  
If an item needs both behaviors‚Äîregular stock item *and* Material Phantom‚Äîcreate two revisions:  
    - One **without** the Material Phantom setting (standard inventory).
    - One **with** the Material Phantom setting (expandable BOM).
:::

## Explanation (Why)

- **Phantom Items** simplify production by embedding child BOMs directly into parent orders.  
- **Material Phantoms** combine the benefits of phantom explosion with the flexibility of stocking and selling.  
- **Bind Phantom Header Qty** guarantees consistent scaling of BOM quantities, reducing manual adjustments.
