# Not Exclude Mode

When the conditions of one mode are met, it generates an MO and calculates the value only for that mode, leaving the value for the second mode unchanged. The conditions of the second mode are not recalculated. This indicates a lack of synchronization between the modes, meaning that when an event satisfies the conditions of one mode, only the values for that mode are updated.
