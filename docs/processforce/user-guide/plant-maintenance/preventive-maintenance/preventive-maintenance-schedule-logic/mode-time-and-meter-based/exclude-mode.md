# Exclude Mode

When the Time-Based conditions are met, the system generates the MO while skipping the Meter-Based conditions for that iteration, recalculating values for both modes. Conversely, when the Meter-Based conditions are met, the system generates the MO and skips the Time-Based conditions, recalculating values for both modes. This ensures the synchronization of both modes, meaning that when one modeâ€™s conditions are satisfied, values for both modes are recalculated.
