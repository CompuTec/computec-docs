# Process Flow

Subcontracting is an essential process in manufacturing that involves outsourcing specific tasks or services to external suppliers. This guide outlines a detailed step-by-step process to effectively utilize the subcontracting function by adding items to a manufacturing order. Following these steps ensures smooth execution, accurate record-keeping, and seamless integration within SAP Business One.

---

## Create a Manufacturing Order

- The order type defaults to "External".
- The Subcontractor Code (found on the "Others" tab) is automatically populated based on the item purchased for the service.

## Create a Purchase Order for the Service

- Use the context menu in the manufacturing order to generate a related purchase order.
    ![Purchase Order](./media/process-flow/purchase-order.png)

- Alternatively, configure automatic generation of purchase orders or purchase order requests for subcontracting tasks after posting the manufacturing order. You can check how to do that [here](../../system-initialization/general-settings/subcontracting-tab.md)

### Purchase Order is created

- Supplier Code defaults from the subcontractor code in the manufacturing order.
- Manufacturing Order number is copied into the Purchase Order for reference.
- Planned Quantity of the Service item is copied into the Purchase Order.
- Price of the Item defaults from the SAP Business One Price List.

### Review Related Purchase Orders

- Access the Subcontracting Procurement Report via the context menu in the manufacturing order.

    ![Review related Purchase Orders](./media/process-flow/purchase-order-01.png)

- This report lists all purchase orders linked to the manufacturing order for easy tracking.

## Move Inventory Items to Subcontractor Warehouse

- Use Transfer All Components to move all inventory associated with the manufacturing order, regardless of what has already been transferred.
- Use Transfer Components to move only the required inventory. If no transfer occurs, it indicates that sufficient inventory is already available in the subcontractorâ€™s warehouse for the manufacturing order.

### Inventory Transfer

- An Inventory Transfer document is created.
