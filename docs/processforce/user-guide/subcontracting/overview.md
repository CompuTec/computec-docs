# Overview

Subcontracting is a method used to manage the "purchase of a service" within the production process. For example, items may be sent to a subcontractor for services such as painting, heat treatment, or annealing.

In this process, the service is integrated into the production flow without changing the Item Code for the parent product.

Subcontracting in CompuTec ProcessForce can be carried out using one of the following methods:

- **Subcontractor-Type Resource**: utilizing subcontractor-type resources to manage the external service within the production process.
- **External-Type Manufacturing Order**: creating an external manufacturing order to handle the subcontracting tasks.
