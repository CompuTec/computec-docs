In quality control, understanding why tests fail is crucial for driving improvements and preventing recurring issues. The Reason, Reason Groups, and NCMR Reason setups enable users to define, categorize, and analyze failure reasons within the quality control process.

The Reason form allows the user to define the Reasons why a specific [Test Property](./test-properties.md) and [Item Property](../item-details/item-properties.md) fail during the Quality Control Test process. These defined reasons are critical for in-depth analysis and reporting.

Key features include:

- **Reason Codes**: Unique identifiers for documenting specific failure reasons.
- **Used Count**: Tracks how often each Reason Code is used, offering insights into recurring issues.

Key features include:

- **Reason Codes**: Specific to NCMR-related test failures.
- **Used Count**: Tracks the usage frequency of each NCMR Reason Code for better reporting.
