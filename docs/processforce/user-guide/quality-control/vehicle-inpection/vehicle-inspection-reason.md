# Vehicle Inspection Reason

The Vehicle Inspection Reason feature allows you to create predefined values that can be used later in the [Vehicle Inspection](../vehicle-inpection/overview.md) document. These reasons appear in a drop-down list for specific options (e.g., for documenting spoiled products, you can select "Rotten" as the Vehicle Inspection Reason). This feature ensures consistency and accuracy in categorizing inspection results.

You can access the Vehicle Inspection Reason setup through the following path:

:::info Path
    Administration → Setup → Vehicle Inspection → Vehicle Inspection Reasons

By checking a specific checkbox, you can control which options will be available in the Vehicle Inspection document, streamlining the selection process during the inspection.

:::info Path
    Administration → Setup → Vehicle Inspection → Vehicle Inspection Groups
