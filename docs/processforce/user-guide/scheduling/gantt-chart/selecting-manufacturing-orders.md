This guide explains how to select and deselect Manufacturing Orders (MOs) for scheduling visualization within the Gantt chart. You will learn how to use filters, apply criteria, and control which MOs appear in the chart.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- Ensure you have access to the Manufacturing Orders list within the scheduling interface.
- Confirm that your user role allows viewing and modifying order selections.

Follow these steps to filter, select and display Manufacturing Orders on the Gantt chart:

1. **Open the Extended Filter**

    Open the Extended Filter section in the scheduling interface.  
    This feature allows you to define criteria for selecting Manufacturing Orders that will be displayed on the Gantt chart.

2. **Apply Selection Criteria**

    You can filter and select Manufacturing Orders using one or multiple criteria.  
    Common options include:

    - **Required Date (From/To):** Filter orders based on their required completion date range.

    - **Used Resources:** Filter by specific machines or work centers.  
    - **Manufacturing Order Item:** Focus on particular items being produced.  
    - **Warehouse:** Select orders linked to a specific storage or production location.

    You can mix multiple criteria to refine the results.

    - **To deselect all orders:** Click the column header **“Show in Gantt.”**
