# Item Groups

Effective inventory management requires proper categorization of products to streamline reporting, analysis, and operational efficiency. Item Groups help classify similar products, such as acids, solvents, boxes, and bottles, while Item Group Groups provide a higher-level classification by grouping multiple item groups. This hierarchical structure improves organization and simplifies data management.

For enhanced classification, Item Group Groups allow users to group multiple item groups under a broader category. This helps in structured reporting and analysis.

For example, an item may belong to the Boxes group while also being classified under Packaging at a higher level.
