# System Requirements

To ensure optimal performance and compatibility, ProcessForce requires specific system environment settings. As an SAP Business One lightweight extension (add-on), its system requirements align with the version of SAP Business One it is installed with.

    You can download the latest release of the application from the [ProcessForce Downloads](../releases/download.md) site.

## General Requirements

ProcessForce has minimal hardware demands, but additional memory may be necessary on systems utilizing features like the Gantt chart or Cost Roll-Up. The required memory varies based on data volume, ranging from 1-2 GB to 16 GB. The application itself requires at least 130 MB of disk space.

## Software Requirements

In addition, ProcessForce requires:

- **Microsoft .NET Framework** – .NET Framework 4.7 is the minimum version supported by ProcessForce 10.0.
- We recommend installing the latest version of .NET Framework – you can use the Windows Update tool or download the required installer file manually using this [Microsoft site](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime).
- To determine which .NET Framework version is installed in a system, please visit this [Microsoft Docs site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed).
