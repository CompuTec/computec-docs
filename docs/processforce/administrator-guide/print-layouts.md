# Print Layouts

This page lists the available **CompuTec ProcessForce print layout files**, including versions for both Microsoft SQL Server and SAP HANA environments. These layouts are provided in English and are updated periodically with bug fixes, layout improvements and additional support for SAP HANA.

---

## Scope

- Includes standard print layouts used in CompuTec ProcessForce modules.
- Contains layout files with header, detail, and properties sections for documents like Routing and Bill of Materials.
- Provides both SQL Server (`.rpt`) and SAP HANA-compatible versions (`.zip` or `.rpt` with procedures).

## Update and Availability Notes

> ℹ️ **Ongoing Updates**  
Updated and corrected print layouts are published on this page until they are fully integrated into CompuTec ProcessForce installer.

> ℹ️ **Issue Reporting**  
To report issues with any listed report, use the [CompuTec Support Portal](http://support.computec.pl/) (select the *Support ProcessForce* project, and the *Print Layouts or Reports* component).

> ⚠️ **Custom Modifications**  
If you plan to customize any layout or report, ensure that you **create a backup**. Default layout files (with "ProcessForce" in their name) may be **overwritten during updates**, potentially resulting in the loss of changes.

## Compatibility

> ⚠️ **For SAP HANA Users**  
To use these layouts in SAP Business One for SAP HANA, you must **execute the included SQL procedures** on the appropriate HANA database.
