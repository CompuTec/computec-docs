# Multiple Branches

**Feature:** Support for SAP Business One Multiple Branches in CompuTec ProcessForce

CompuTec ProcessForce is fully compatible with the **Multiple Branches** functionality available in SAP Business One. This feature allows users to manage and assign branches to transactions and documents across the system.

---

## Behavior in CompuTec ProcessForce

- Branch support in CompuTec ProcessForce works identically to how it does in standard SAP Business One.
- No additional configuration or setup is required within CompuTec ProcessForce to enable branch usage.
- Branch assignment on ProcessForce documents is handled through the standard SAP Business One branch setup and selection mechanisms.

### Requirements

- Branches must be configured in SAP Business One using its native **Multiple Branches** functionality.
