## Adding User Define Field to ProcessForce Object

If a partner decides to add a User Defined Field during an implementation phase to any of ProcessForce objects, a prefix should be added to the field name, e.g., a shortcut from the partner's company name.

This is required to omit any name conflicts in the future.

### Example

If your chosen shortcut is **AB** and you would like to add a new field **weight**, you should add a field named **AB_weight**. Therefore in your company database, you will have **the U_AB_weight** database field.
