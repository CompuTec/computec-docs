# License Import and Assignment

Setting up CompuTec ProcessForce for the first time requires importing and assigning the appropriate license. This process ensures that the add-on functions correctly within SAP Business One.

:::info
    If you are upgrading CompuTec ProcessForce rather than performing a fresh installation, you may skip these steps.
:::

:::info
    Assigning the CompuTec ProcessForce license works similarly to the SAP Business One license assignment.
