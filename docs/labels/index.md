## What is it?

CompuTec Labels is an multi-faceted solution that efficiently manages printing templates and label printers in the company. CompuTec Labels is an SAP Business One solution that allows you to manage all printing templates and label printers and make sure inventory is labelled exactly as it should be. Using CompuTec Labels, you can print documents from SAP Business One and CompuTec applications: CompuTec ProcessForce, CompuTec WMS and CompuTec PDC. Data included on printed labels can be predefined with a number of settings.

- Manage many kinds of printers simultaneously, no matter what drivers it use: Crystal, Zebra, or Bixolon.
- Assign specific templates to a particular printer and define an action that starts printing, e.g., adding/ updating a document or choosing the option manually.
- Pull real-time data from SAP Business One and other CompuTec solutions to create the labels you need
- Automate label printing and set up very specific printing rules to define where, when and by whom labels can be printed
- Ensure labelling consistency throughout the business

The solution is highly customizable and can be tailored to accommodate a wide range of business processes.

## How does it work?

- [Installation and Configuration](./setup/overview.md)

---

- Choose a company – all SAP Business One installation companies are available. The application settings are set up for a specific database
- Create a printing rule (template is assigned to it) - here, you can define in which situations it is possible to print a label. A number of settings are available.
- Setting up trigger events – printing can be run using a proper option from a requester application (manual printing). We can also set up a trigger event, e.g., printing on a document add or update
- Mapping table – what information would we like to have on a print

---

- Logs and Requests – you can check logs of every operation performed on the application from its level. You can also contain a list of all the requests to the application.
