# Downtime

Downtime refers to a temporary break in work caused by unforeseen circumstances, such as power outages or equipment failures. Properly tracking and managing downtime is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and minimizing disruptions. CompuTec PDC offers a straightforward method to register and monitor downtime effectively.
