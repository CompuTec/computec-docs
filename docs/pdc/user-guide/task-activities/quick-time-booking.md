# Quick Time Booking

Managing time bookings efficiently is crucial in streamlining manufacturing operations. The Quick Time Booking feature allows you to record time bookings for multiple Manufacturing Orders simultaneously, all from a single panel. This eliminates the need to create and open separate task tiles, saving time and enhancing productivity.
