# Quality Control Test/Item Properties

The Quality Control Test/Item Properties feature allows users to check and record tests and item properties associated with a Quality Control Test. To make this option available, simply enable the QC Test Properties from the [custom options for Task Panel](../../customization/overview.md#task-tile-and-task-panel-customization). Once activated, the button becomes active if there is an existing Quality Control Test linked to a specific Manufacturing Order or its associated Operation. For more details on how to verify this, refer to the related [ProcessForce documentation entry](/docs/processforce/user-guide/quality-control/quality-control-test/overview#transaction)
