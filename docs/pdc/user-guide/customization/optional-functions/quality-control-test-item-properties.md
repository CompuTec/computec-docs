# Quality Control Test/Item Properties

The Quality Control Test/Item Properties feature enables users to review and record tests and item properties associated with a Quality Control Test. To activate this option, simply enable QC Test Properties from the [custom options for Task Panel](../../customization/overview.md#task-tile-and-task-panel-customization). Once enabled, the button becomes available when a Quality Control Test is linked to a specific Manufacturing Order or its associated Operation. For more details on verification, refer to the related [ProcessForce documentation entry](/docs/processforce/user-guide/quality-control/quality-control-test/overview#transaction).
