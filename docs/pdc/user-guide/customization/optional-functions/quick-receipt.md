# Quick Receipt

The Quick Receipt feature streamlines the process of receiving Final Goods from production for a specific Manufacturing Order. By consolidating all necessary details into a single panel, this option speeds up the reception process, ensuring greater efficiency and accuracy in handling production receipts.

## Access

There are two ways to access the Quick Receipt panel:

- The Quick Receipt button is not available by default. It must be assigned via [Customization](../../customization/overview.md#task-tile-and-task-panel-customization) option:

        - If set to 'No' or 'On Pick Order', the Quantity field is filled based on the Pack Size (unless the remaining quantity is smaller, in which case it is set to 0).
        - If set to 'Both' or 'On Pick Receipt', the Quantity field reflects the actual quantity.
- **Atrribute Table**: the attribute table allows defining attribute values for a receipt document (based on User-Defined Fields):
