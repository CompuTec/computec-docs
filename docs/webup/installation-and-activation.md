# Installation and Activation

This section describes the **installation and activation workflow** for the **WebUp extension** within the **CompuTec AppEngine Framework**.

---

## Overview

The **WebUp** solution consists of three components:  

- **CompuTec WebUp App** – handles all customization and automation logic and stores persistent configuration settings.  
- **CompuTec WebUp Manager** – provides the user interface for creating, editing, and testing configurations.  
- **CompuTec WebUp Client** – extends the SAP Business One Web Client where the standard extensibility framework is limited.  

---

**CompuTec AppEngine** must be installed and configured. Follow the [Installation](/docs/appengine/administrators-guide/configuration-and-administration/installation) & [Configuration](/docs/appengine/administrators-guide/configuration-and-administration/configuration) instructions.

## 2. Company and Web Client Activation

## 5. Important Information

### Validate CORS Configuration in SAP Web Client

When activating a company in AppEngine, the system provides instructions for setting up CORS for the Web Client. Please ensure the configuration is correct and you have followed the **Content Security Policy** setup for the SAP Web Client.

## Plugin Update

Updates are handled directly through the **AE Store**, following the same workflow as installation.  
The process preserves **assignments** and **configuration profiles**.
For new versions of the browser extension, you will be prompted after installation.

---

## Integration Verification

After installation, verify that both components — the **AppEngine plugin** and the **browser extension** — are active and communicating correctly.
