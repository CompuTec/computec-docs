Send Events Job has to be active for a specific company. Click [here](/docs/appengine/administrators-guide/configuration-and-administration/overview) to find out more.

| Option | Description |
|--- | --- |
| <u>AllUpdatesInOneTransaction</u> |When it is set to true, all of the related updates have to be successful (otherwise no update is performed). <br/>If it is set to false, in case of failure on one of the Manufacturing Orders, the rest of them will be still updated.|
| <u>IncludeChanges</u>: <li>Items</li> <li>Coproducts</li> <li>Scraps</li> | These elements are taken under consideration during an update (each of the element can be switched off) |
| <u>ManufacturingOrdersStatuses</u>: <li>NotScheduled</li> <li>Scheduled</li> <li>Released</li> | Define Manufacturing Orders in which status are taken under consideration during an update (each of the element can be switched off). <br/>Other Manufacturing Order statuses are not available because of being not editable, e.g. the Closed status. |
| <u>Subproducts</u> | In this section, you can configure the plugin to work for cases when the Manufacturing Order for the subproduct already exists (meaning, there are Items that are BOMs and there can have related Manufacturing Orders). <br/><br/><u>**ManufacturingOrdersAlreadyExists**</u> <br/>If there are related Manufacturing Orders, then there are two options: <br/><u>Replace for Statuses</u> – a BOM Item line with related Manufacturing Orders in specific status is replaced in the Final Good Manufacturing Order <br/><u>AddForStatuses</u> – a new BOM Item line with related Manufacturing Orders in specific status is added in the Final Good Manufacturing Order <br/><br/><u>ReplacedManufacturingSubOrders</u> – related to the Replace for Statuses option; defines what happens upon the replace. <br/>FinishforStatuses – set status to Finish for the replaced Manufacturing Orders in specific statuses |
| <u>Alerts</u> | You can define whether user will get alerts upon successful or failed updates. |
