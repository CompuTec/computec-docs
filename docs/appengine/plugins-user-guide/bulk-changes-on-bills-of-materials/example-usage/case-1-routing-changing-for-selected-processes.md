# Case 1 â€“ Routing Changing for Selected Processes

Requirement: <br/>When a routing is changed, it must be possible to replace it in the production process. We can change the following things:

- Operations
- Resources for operations
- Times
After changing the Routing there should be a possibility to choose whether we change it in every process or only in selected ones.
