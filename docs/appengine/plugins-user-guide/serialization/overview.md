# Overview

In the installation section you can find information supplementary to the standard installation of plug-ins described here that allow you to use serialization in CompuTec WMS and in Process Force.

In the field description section you can find a detailed description of the serialization configuration in the WEB application that allows you to perform serialization in accordance to various standards and process scenarios, e.g. clustering.

In the example usage section you can find a step by step description of an example clustering process, starting with the configuration in the WEB application through the clustering process implemented in CompuTec WMS, and the basic transactions carried out in CompuTec WMS using SN ending. This is the best place to start.
