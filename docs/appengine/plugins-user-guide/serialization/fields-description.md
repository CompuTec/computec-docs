# Serialization: Fields Description

Here you can find a description of all of the configuration fields that affect the serialization process.

---

## SAP Business One/ProcessForce – Item Declaration

### Item Master Data

Only for Items (managed by Batches) with Serialization enabled = Yes are available to be assigned SPT.

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/image2019-7-19-14-48-47.png)

**Serialization enabled = Yes**, Item with all revisions enabled for serialization, is selectable for Rule definition.

## WMS - Custom Configuration

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/image2020-1-19-10-16-23.png)

**Enable Serialization** – allows the use of serialization in WMS

**Reuse Storage Unit** – allows reusing the same packages (SSCC) in the reception process

**Show button printing label Storage Unit** – allows you to print manually labels for the package (the button will be visible in WMS)

**Possibility fill up SSCC code manually** – user can enter an SSCC code manually without using a scanner

**Possibility change SSCC code** – user can change the SSCC code generated by the system in the process of accepting packages

**Always do process verification** – by default, the verification process is only made for those series that require it, this option always forces the process to pass

## WEB application – Serialization Configuration

Steps for configuring serialization are as follows:

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/serialization.png)

First, define Attributes Template. Then from these templates, you are able to define Serialization Parameters Templates. The next obligatory step is to set up Rules. Step 4 is not required for clustering. It useful if you produce serialized products and you received SN pools from a customer or you have to generate SN pools according to determined schemes.

You can find an example of a clustering case here: [Example usage: clustering](../serialization/example-usage-clustering.md).

### Attribute Templates

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/image2020-1-13-4-39-6.png)

#### Attributes list window

List with all defined attributes. Here you can start adding a new one or modify the existing.

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/list-of-attributes-all.png)

#### Single Attribute window add/view/edit

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/iso-country-code.png)

    1. **Code** – attribute's code
    2. **Name** – attribute’s name
    3. **Type** – a type of data (Text, Date, Time, Integer, Decimal)
    4. **Default Value** – enabled when Type = Text
    5. **GS1 ID** – ID in accordance with GS1 standard
    6. **Maximum Length** – a length of the SPT's component
    7. **Source** – Batch Details, Document Line, Serial Details
    8. **Field** – for Batch Details: Batch Number, Supplier Batch, Expiry Date, Batch Attribute 1, Batch Attribute 2; <br/>for Document Line: Base document Entry; for Serial Details: Serial Number, Remarks <br/>**Note**: Source and Field defined only for non-UNP Segments
    9. **Trim From, Trim To** – start and end position of an attribute in UNP, determine which part of the attribute is added to the UNP ID.
    10. **UNP ID Sequence** - if value is different than null, given attribute is included in UNP ID. <br/>Value of this field determines position of the Attribute in UNP ID. <br/>**UNP ID Sequence = "null"** - given attribute isn't included in UNP ID
    11. **Clustering ID** – if the selected attribute is a clustering parameter
    12. **Mandatory GRPO** – attribute is obligatory for Good Receipt Purchase Order
    13. **Mandatory MOR receipt** – attribute is obligatory for Receipt from production
    14. **Display in WMS** – field will be visible on the WMS device's screen
    15. **Common in WMS** – field will be displayed in the upper part on WMS device's screen (will not disappear when other fields are saved)
    16. **Description for WMS** – you can define the field's label for WMS
    17. **Remarks** – you can describe any additional information related to the attribute

### Serialization Parameters Templates (SPT)

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/image2020-1-13-14-38-42.png)

Here you can pin Attribute Templates in one SPT it accordance with used serialization standard. Each component of SPT you have to assign to a Field from the Track & Trace Table according to attribute type.

#### SPT list window

List with all defined SPT. From this place, you can start to add the new one or to modify the existing one.

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/image2020-1-13-14-45-56.png)

#### Singe SPT window add/view/edit

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/serialization-parameters-templates.png)

#### Header

1. **Template Code** – SPT 's template code
2. **Template Name** – SPT's template name
3. **Is Active** – checked by default. If checked can be used in Rules
4. **Remarks** – some additional remarks

#### Attributes Tab

To add Attribute to the list you have to select [+]. In the column Attribute, you have to select Attribute Template and assign it to Attribute in column Field with a type compatible with Attribute's Template type. You are able to modify the Attribute’s parameters. Descriptions of fields are available at: Attribute's list window.

#### Pool Tab

You can assign a previously defined pool to the SPT (please see chapter Serial Numbers Pulls). One of them you should select as default.

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/image2020-1-13-15-59-7.png)

### Rules

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/image2020-1-13-15-27-14.png)

Define rules which will be used to decide which SPT should be used for serialized Item/Revision.

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/image2020-1-13-15-39-38.png)

1. **Priority** – information managed by the system. Inform you about the rules hierarchy.
2. **Rule Code** – Rule's code
3. **Rule Name** – Rule's name
4. **Item Group** – you can select Item Group from the combo-box. The rule for Items Group overwrite the rule in which the Item Group is not specified (Default rule in a picture above ).
5. **Item Code** – you can select Item from the list of items. This rule defined for Item overwrites the rule for Item Group and the Default rule. <br/>**Note**: In the list of items are only visible Items with Serialization enabled = Yes in Item Master Data
6. **Item Revision** – you can select Item's revision from the list (before that you have to specified Item). The rule for revision overwrites the rule for Item, Item Group, and Default
7. **Result SPT** – you have to select SPT from the list.

**The logic of SPT assignment priority when you select Item/Revision for Serialization in WMS**:

    1. Find Rule for Item/Revision combination. If it does not exist:
    2. Find Rule for Item. If it does not exist:
    3. Find Rule for Item Group. If it does not exist:
    4. Find Default Rule. If it does not exist, the system displays a warning in CompuTec WMS.

When you define a rule for a particular Item/Revision, it will be as a first choice. If you want to assign SPT to all Item’s revisions (besides these for which you have to define a rule in 1st priority) you have to only define Item Code, this is the 2nd priority. If you want to assign SPT to all items from a particular group (besides these for which you have to define a rule in 1st and 2nd priority) you have to only define Items Group. For all Item/revisions for which you have not defined rules in priority 1 or 2 or 3, the default rule will be used. To define the Default rule please leave empty fields: Items Group, Item Code, Item Revision. You are able to define only one rule of this kind.

### Serialization Number Pool Definition

![Serialization - Fields Description](./media/field-description/image2020-1-13-15-45-44.png)

### Serialization Numbers Pools window

This is a list of all defined Pools. From here you can start to add a new one or modify the existing.

    3. **Type** – Serial Numbers in a Pull can be allocated or generated
    4. **CSV file with serial numbers** – for allocated - externally file - select button **Browse -> Import**

#### Single document add/view/edit window

![Field Description](./media/field-description/image2020-1-14-17-34-31.png)

In this window, you can filter information according to CompuTec WMS’s document structure.
