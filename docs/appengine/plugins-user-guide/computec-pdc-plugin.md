# CompuTec PDC Plugin

:::info
This manual presents how to work with CompuTec PDC and AppEngine. It is not a manual for CompuTec PDC application (which is available [here](/docs/pdc/)).
:::

PDC stands for Plant Data Capture: the application allows to record production task by using ProcessForce Time Bookings documents directly from production floor via mobile touchscreen devices. It records time spent on specific tasks or operations, allows you to oversee the precise details about any given operation such as machine data, features, operational history and item details and using the management panel you can supervise your entire machine park and its operations as well as check resource status.

PDC on AppEngine gives you more speed and makes work-time record more effective.
