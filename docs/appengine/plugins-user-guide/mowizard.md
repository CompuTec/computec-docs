# MOWizard

The purpose of this plugin is to create Manufacturing Orders based on chosen Sales Orders' lines. It allows managing multilevel, complex product trees swiftly. Creation of this plugin was inspired by cases of companies that have large numbers of Manufacturing Orders related to a single line on a Sales Order.

    ![MOWizard](./media/mowizard/mowizard-sale-orders-selection.png)

    The Available Sales Orders Positions table holds Sales Orders lines that can be filtered by many conditions (the Filter Available Sales Orders Positions section).

    Checking the required checkboxes and clicking Add Selected Positions moves them to the Selected Sales Orders Positions table (click the checkbox in the first row to mark all of the lines in the list). These Sales Orders' lines will be further processed.
    Here you can still change quantity:
    ![MOWizard](./media/mowizard/mowizard-selected-quantity.png)
    After this, Click Step 3. 

    3. Manufacturing Orders.
    Here click Generate Manufacturing Orders. Click Yes in the system message form:
    ![MOWizard](./media/mowizard/mowizard-generating-orders.png)

    Click the Yes button to continue. The creation is not immediate and some time is needed to complete it, depends on number of Manufacturing Orders and their structure. Started Jobs are displayed in the Running tab (please check the second screenshot on this page).

    You can see the prepared manufacturing tree in a map and table form.
    At this moment manufacturing trees are generated but no Manufacturing Order is yet created.

    4. Once the manufacturing tree is created, the related job is moved from the Running tab to the Prepared tab. Once the job is generated, it is not possible to change any data in it. Click the required job line in the Prepared tab to see the related data.
    Here you can see the chosen data in form of a manufacturing tree (the Map tab, showing relations between linked Manufacturing Orders) or a table (the Table tab).
    The map view shows the manufacturing tree divided by material groups.
    This section is for data preview only.

    5. Click the Step 5 button to go to the Planning section.
    Here you can see information on the planned Manufacturing Orders.
    If you want to choose specific Manufacturing Orders, click the Edit button at the top of the form.
    You can change numbering series and Manufacturing dates. If you change the dates, click the Reschedule button after that.
    Once the editing is finished, click the Summary button.

    6. Here you can see the Manufacturing Orders that are about to be created.
    Link child MOR's option is checked by default.

    7. Click Save and Run. The job is now moved to the Running tab. When all planned Manufacturing Orders are created, the job will be moved to the Completed tab. If not all of the Manufacturing Orders were created (e.g. because a child Manufacturing Order was chosen in the edit mode but not a higher level Manufacturing Order), the job will be moved back to the Prepared tab. Here you can click the job and check which Manufacturing Orders were created, which were not and why (click the Manufacturing Order with the Failure status to get this information).
