# Overview

The purpose of the MO360 plugin is to track the current flow of Manufacturing Orders. The system displays the planned Gantt chart and draws currently performed activities. Additionally, the plugin includes the [Assignment Board](/docs/appengine/plugins-user-guide/manufacturing-order-360/assignment-board/), which allows you to assign Employees and Teams to the created tasks.
