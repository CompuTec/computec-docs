## Initial Configuration

System Landscape Directory (SLD) is a service that SAP uses to maintain an inventory of all the companies and systems within the SAP landscape. The SLD helps in managing system configurations, ensuring that the SAP environment is optimized and up-to-date with the necessary settings for each entity. Here are the steps to configure connection to the SLD server and activate associated companies.

You can find the SLD Server Address in SAP Business One, License Administration.

### Steps to Perform Initial Configuration

1. Begin by configuring connection to the SLD server by specifying the **SLD ServerAddress** and connection to **CompuTec License Server**.

    ![Initial Configuration](./media/configuration-and-administration/initial-configuration.png)

2. After entering the details, Click **Save and Discover**

    ![Initial Configuration](./media/configuration-and-administration/initial-configuration-01.png)

3. After connecting to the SLD server, you will be presented with a **list of companies** configured within the SAP landscape. You can run Dicover at any time to refresh the list of avaiable companies.

    ![List of Companies](./media/configuration-and-administration/companies.png)

4. Each Company that is activated for use in AppEngine needs credentials to Database Server. You can specify credentials for each company separately or provide default Database User in Server Details section.

    ![Database User Credentials](./media/configuration-and-administration/database-user-credentials.png)

5. In Companies section you can see statuses of companies used within AppEngine. To activate Company simply click on Active Switch as shown below. This process will guide you through the activation process asking for all required information's.

    ![Company Status](./media/configuration-and-administration/company-status.png)

6. Choose a user for the installation process. If a suitable user does not already exist, specify a new SAP B1 user account. **This process do not create user in SAP. It is just creating user in the AppEngine**. This user needs to have the necessary permissions in SAP Business One to handle installation and configuration tasks. This user will be also used as default for future installations and background processing tasks.

    ![Assign Default User](./media/configuration-and-administration/assign-default-user-01.png)

7. Log in using **SLD Server user** to activate the company within the SAP system. This step ensures that the selected company is properly activated and integrated with the SLD server. This process also includes installation of the necessary SAP extensions like CompuTec Start. In Case of Cloud Control Center manual installation of CompuTec Start is required.

    ![Activate Company](./media/configuration-and-administration/activate-companies.png)

    This will show the **Activation Progress**.

    ![Activation Progress](./media/configuration-and-administration/activation-progress.png)

8. Assign a **default user** to the company, which will be used for background processing tasks.

    ![Assign Default User](./media/configuration-and-administration/assign-default-user.png)

    If a suitable user does not already exist, create a **new user** account.

9. Set up and configure **background processing** within the SAP environment. AppEngine allows to create plugins with jobs that reacts on various event from SAP Business One. To be able to achieve this procedure needs to be added into SBO_SP_POSTTRANSACTIONNOTICE. This procedure is responsible for storing events that will be consumed by AppEngine to trigger jobs.

    ![Background Processing](./media/configuration-and-administration/background-processing.png)

    Perform the procedure described in the message:
