Once the configuration is finished, you can log in to the Launchpad <!-- TODO: Link -->.

## Background processing

AppEngine plugins are designed to be used on users' actions: e.g. a user opens it, changes settings, adds or updates data. But it is also possible to configure actions (jobs) to be performed in the background (independently from any user, even when no one is logged in): upon a specific event or at a specific time (e.g. every 5 minutes).

### Activation

Switch the switch in the Background Processing State column in the [SLD Servers tab](/docs/appengine/administrators-guide/configuration-and-administration/overview#sld-servers) (please check the previous screenshot on this page) and log in using SAP Business One credentials. The following message will be displayed upon the first activation:

![Background](./media/configuration-and-administration/background-processing-message.webp)

Perform the procedure described in the message.

### Configuration

![Plugins](./media/configuration-and-administration/plugins-configuration.webp)

Send Events Job – this job is always present, it is installed with AppEngine (the other jobs from the example screenshot above comes from the installed plugins). It checks the designated table in a database every 10 seconds for new events and sends them to the right plugin-related jobs.

Clicking a job tile leads to its details. Here you can check:

- information on the recent calls: start/end date and time, company and user, exceptions (if there are any). Jobs other than SEventJob have an additional column: EventBus message. It holds information on what was sent to the specific job (what event).
- companies: databases for which the job is active with a user (by default it is the user set in the [SLD Servers tab](/docs/appengine/administrators-guide/configuration-and-administration/overview#sld-servers), it can be changed here just for the specific job)
- logs: log files, also available in the [Trace tab](/docs/appengine/administrators-guide/configuration-and-administration/overview#trace-1).

### EventBus Live Preview

The preview of all current events from all checked databases.

## Plugins

![Administration](./media/configuration-and-administration/administration-panel-plugins.webp)

To install a new plugin, click the Install plugin button in the upper-right corner of the form and load a plugin file. E.g. any from the [Plugins page](/docs/appengine/releases/appengine/download). Note that the plugin files are always delivered as zip files – load them in this form, do not unzip them before loading.

After loading a file you will get a system message about restarting AppEngine. You can decide whether to do it now or later (note that the loaded plugin will be available after the restart).

After the installation, click the required plugin's tile for further configuration.

For the Download SAP WebClient Extension function description, click [here](/docs/appengine/administrators-guide/configuration-and-administration/working-with-sap-business-one-web-client)

### Companies

Clicking one of the tiles in the Plugins section leads to the following view:

![Active Plugin](./media/configuration-and-administration/activate-plugin.webp)

Here you can activate the plugin for a specific database by switching the switch in the Activate column. If the plugin requires the installation of some object on the database (e.g. user-defined objects, tables), the Update button will appear upon switching in on on a database. Click it to complete the installation (logging in with SAP Business One database credentials is required).

Now the plugin is available in the Launchpad:

![Installed Plugins](./media/configuration-and-administration/installed-plugin.webp)

### SAP Business One settings

:::note
    SAP Business One (with ProcessForce installed) main menu → Administration → System Initialization → General Settings → ProcessForce tab → AE tab
:::

![SAP B1 Settings](./media/configuration-and-administration/appengine-sapb1-settings.webp)

After activating a plugin, go to SAP Business One for further configuration.

Check the checkbox, put in the address (by default: `http://localhost:54000`).

Choose From opening mode: in form (within SAP Business One forms), in browser (in the system's default internet browser), or both.

Click the Save button and Restart SAP Business One.

### Settings

![Plugin Settings](./media/configuration-and-administration/plugins-settings.webp)

On a plugin development level, it is possible to create a set of settings for it. If it was created during plugin development, they are available here

### Logs

Here you can check plugin performance related events, search the log and filter it by error, warning and info message type.

## Settings

![AppEngine Settings](./media/configuration-and-administration/app-engine-settings.webp)

This section holds information on the whole AppEngine installation configuration with a possibility to edit some of the values.

<u>Development</u> – plugin development-related settings. Click here to find out more

<u>SLD Servers</u> – here you can find settings from the SLD Servers section

<u>General</u> – here you can change i.a. a default attachment folder, default ports.

<u>Administration</u> – here you can check the AppEngine username and password

<u>Components</u> – here you can check settings related to the installed plugins.

## Trace

Here you can find a log of exceptions regarding AppEngine performance.

### Trace Configuration

Here you can set other then the default error logging level. The levels are as follows (from the one of the broadest range): Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal, Off. By default, this setting is set to Error. Please note that any change made here is valid per an AppEngine session – after the application restart the setting will go back to the default value.

### Trace

![AppEngine Trace](./media/configuration-and-administration/appengine-trace.webp)

Here you can find the exceptions log. You can filter it by a time range and by type:

- AppEngine – general events, also related to plugins
- Plugin – events related to plugins' initializations
- BackgroundProcessing – events related to jobs.

Click a required log file to check its content. Then you can filter it by message type – Errors, Warnings, or Info – (1) and download the log file (2):

![Download trace](./media/configuration-and-administration/trace-download.webp)

## System

### System Details

Here you can restart the AppEngine installation and change the AppEngine password.

You can also generate and download a configuration file – a log file with a lot of information about this AppEngine installation, e.g. its version, installed plugins with their versions. The file can be then attached to a support ticket related to this installation for a faster solution.

### Active Connections

![Active Connections](./media/configuration-and-administration/active-connections.webp)

A list of currently active sessions. Click a connection in the Active sessions table to see the Details of it. You can log out any session by clicking the Log Out button.
