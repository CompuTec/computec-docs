## Usage

### Variants

Variants are preset reports. By installing the plugin, you get one standard Variant set as default. You can create and customize the Variants. To create your Variant, open the standard and use the Save As option:

While saving, you can:

- Assign a name to the Variant.
- Set the Variant as the default.
- Define availability as either Public (available for all users) or Private (restricted to the current user).

### Main View

Select a Variant to open a report. The report view consists of two main sections: Filter (1) and Report (2):

#### Filter

Filters allow you to refine the data displayed in your report by entering specific values. You can customize the fields displayed in the filter by clicking the Adapt Filter button.

**In the drop-down list** - Filter all Manufacturing Order fields by the following values: All, Visible, Active, Visible and Active, Mandatory.

**Hide/Show Values** - Manage the visibility of selected filter values.

**List/Group view** - While Group View is planned for future releases, you can currently work with List View.

Selected filters can be represented as micro charts for a visual summary:

#### Report

Reports can be displayed in one of three formats: Chart, Table, or both simultaneously. The display format can be toggled using the following options:

##### Chart Options

**Chart format** - Choose from Line, Vertical Bar, Horizontal Bar, or Pie charts.

**Settings** - Configure dimensions, measures, functions, and sorting options to customize the chart view.

##### Table Options

You can download the table data as an Excel (.xlsx) or CSV (.csv) file. The table includes the following settings:

- **Sorting** - Multi-level sorting, e.g., by Document Date (ascending) and then by Document Time (descending).
- **Visibility** - Select which columns are displayed.
- **Column Freezing** - The "frozen" columns remain visible on the left side of the table, even when you scroll horizontally to view additional data (as shown with the three left columns in the screenshot below).
- **Column Grouping** - Choose a column by which the rows will be grouped. If you choose more than one, the grouping will be performed in levels. The below example shows two levels.
