## Why Use CompuTec WMS?

Warehouse operations are a critical part of your supply chain. Manual, paper-based processes are often error-prone, slow, and hard to track. CompuTec WMS addresses these challenges by offering:

- Real-time warehouse visibility
- Integration with SAP Business One
- Automation of core warehousing tasks
- Detailed traceability via batch and serial numbers
- Enhanced support for manufacturing operations with CompuTec ProcessForce

## How It Works

CompuTec WMS is fully integrated into the SAP Business One ecosystem. It connects mobile devices and barcode scanners to your ERP system, allowing users to perform tasks that immediately reflect in SAP.

The application is tile-based, with each tile representing a warehouse transaction or function. When a user selects a tile - such as *Goods Receipt*, *Pick List*, or *Stock Transfer* - the system prompts them to scan items, enter details, and complete the transaction. The result is a transaction document stored directly in SAP Business One.

Each transaction records:

- Item details
- Batch/Serial data (if enabled)
- Quantities
- Warehouse bins or storage locations
- Dates and remarks
- Users and timestamps
