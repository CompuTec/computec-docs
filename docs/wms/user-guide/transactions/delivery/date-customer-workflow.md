# Date-Customer Workflow

The **Date-Customer Workflow** enables you to select a date first, followed by choosing the corresponding Customer. This approach allows for quick and easy navigation through documents associated with a specific date for any given Customer. It is particularly useful when you need immediate access to documents where Customers have scheduled activities for a certain date.

For instructions on setting up a workflow for Delivery documents, click [here](default-workflow.md).
