# Packing Slip on Delivery

The Delivery process in SAP Business One allows you to move goods out of the warehouse and record them against customer orders. With CompuTec WMS, you can enhance this process by enabling **Packing Slips** to trace Storage Units (SUs).

---

## Purpose

- Record customer deliveries against base documents.  
- Track which items were packed into which Storage Units (SUs).  
- Provide transparency with **Packing Slips**, ensuring accurate logistics and traceability.
