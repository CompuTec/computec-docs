## Options Overview

### Configuration of WMS client-server Connection

 ![WMS Client Server Connection](./media/starting/wms-client-server.png)

To ensure seamless communication between the CompuTec WMS Client and Server, follow the steps below:

1. **Server Address & Port**: Ensure that the server address matches the location where the CompuTec WMS Server is installed. The port number must align with the one specified in the server settings. You can verify this in the server configuration.
2. **Printer Setup**: Define the printer that will handle CompuTec Labels whenever WMS sends a new request. The printer's IP address can be configured in Custom Configuration under the Common tab. For more details, click [here](../administrator-guide/custom-configuration/custom-configuration-functions/common.md).
3. **Scale Integration**: If the CompuTec WMS is intended for use with a scale, enable the Scale checkbox to activate this functionality. Please refer to [weight scale](../user-guide/weight-scales/overview.md) for more information.

## Scanner tab

This tab is specifically designed to manage barcode scanner-related settings within the WMS (Warehouse Management System) Client application.

![Scanner tab](./media/starting/scanner-tab.webp)

**Scanner Prefix**:

- This field allows you to define a specific prefix value that is expected at the beginning of every scanned barcode.
- Example shown: 2 – This means the system will expect scanned data to begin with this prefix.

**Scanner Suffix**:

- A suffix is a character or value appended at the end of the scanned barcode.
- Example shown: 3 – The system will expect the scan to end with this value.

**Scanner Group Separator**:

- This field allows you to specify a character code (ASCII) that separates groups of data in a scanned string.
- Example shown: 29 – ASCII 29 corresponds to the Group Separator (GS) character, commonly used in barcode formats like GS1.

**Enable scanner log (Checkbox)**

- This optional setting, when checked, enables logging of scanner activity.
- Useful for debugging scanner inputs or tracing scan-related issues. In the screenshot, it is not enabled.

## Logs tab

This tab is used for accessing, managing and sharing log files generated by the application.

![Logs tab](./media/starting/logs-tab.webp)

- **Share log**: Use this option to send the selected log file via text message or save it as a file.
- **Send to server**: This option allows you to send the selected log file to the associated server. The default location for the server is: c:\programdata\CompuTec\CompuTec WMS\Server\Logs\ClientLogs\XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX.

This section XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX refers to the device's unique identification number.

## Saving Settings and logging in

Click Save or Cancel on the General tab to save or discard changes. It leads back to the log in form.
