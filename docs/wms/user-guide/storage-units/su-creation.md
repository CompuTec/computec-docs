# SU Creation

The SU Creation function in CompuTec WMS enables users to manually create multiple Storage Units (SUs), each with a defined set of items and quantities. Unlike the SU Wizard, which generates multiple SUs with identical content, SU Creator offers more flexibility - allowing users to review and set item-specific details such as batches and serial numbers for each SU.

This option is ideal when the same item set is packaged repeatedly but requires batch-level or serial-level tracking for each unit.
