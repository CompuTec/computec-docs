# New SU

The New SU function in CompuTec WMS enables users to manually create a **single Storage Unit (SU)** with a customized set of items and quantities. This method is particularly useful when a unique combination of items needs to be grouped into one SU, such as preparing a specific pallet or container for internal transfers, shipments, or tracking.

Unlike SU Wizard or SU Creator, this feature focuses on building just one SU at a time, offering flexibility in content selection and ease of use.
