# SU Pick & Pack

This guide walks you through the SU (Storage Unit) Pick & Pack process in your warehouse operations using two workflows:

- From Sales Order
- From Inventory Transfer

Each method allows warehouse operators to efficiently assemble and pack items into Storage Units (SUs) for dispatch or movement, while tracking batches and quantities at every step. Letâ€™s go through both processes in detail.

## From Sales Order

Begin the Pick & Pack process directly from a Sales Order.

1. Choose the From Sales Order option. The system will prompt for warehouse selection - you can either pick a warehouse or skip this step. Next, the Customer Selection screen appears.

4. Here you can:

    1) add a new Item
    2) add a new SU
    3) assemble an SU from the Items on the list.

    Alternatively, manually enter item quantities and select Batch/Serial Numbers. Selecting the assemble option opens the Items Document form:

5. Clicking any of the row will lead to the list of available Batches with quantities.

6. The Item row turns green After choosing a Batch and setting the whole quantity.

    If the whole quantity is set, the row stays grey, and in the upper right corner, there is an indication of the picked/total quantity. Click the save button after selecting the whole quantity.

7. Saving Batch and quantity for the SU leads to the Document Details form. You can see the completed Items (marked with green color, with a note that the whole quantities are on the SU) and the added SU:
