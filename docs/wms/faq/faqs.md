# FAQs

## Installed WMS, not working

### <i>**What to do**</i>

**1. Configuration**

    In addition to installing the CompuTec WMS components, you must configure the application, such as setting up a database connection. You can find more information about this [here](../administrator-guide/installation/wms-server/overview.md).

**2. Windows firewall inbound rule**

    Be sure to set a required inbound rule in the Windows firewall. You can check how to do that [here](../administrator-guide/installation/wms-server/overview.md).

**3. Server and Client connection addresses**

    Check server and client connection addresses. If both components are installed on the same machine, an entry of “localhost,” e.g., `http://localhost:31002`, works, but if the server and the client component are installed on different machines, specific addresses should be written in. You can do that in the options tab on the client application.

    To check the connection on ports between server and workstation (in case CompuTec WMs Client operates on a different machine than CompuTec WMS Server), please perform the following steps:

    - Download the PsPing tool from this localization: [PsPing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psping) and unpack it.
    - Open Windows Command Prompt and navigate to the unpacked PSPing folder, e.g., cd C:\Support\PSTools
    - Run the following commands:

        `psping64.exe -t -i 1 localhost:31002`

        `psping64.exe -t -i 1 [remote host IP]:31002`

        Example:

        ![Command](./media/ping-example.webp)

**4. CompuTec WMS API Test**

    Please check if the CompuTec WMS API works correctly by going into a web browser to this address:

    `http://localhost:31002/API/test/get`

    `http://[remote host IP]:31002/API/test/get`

**5. WMS services check**

    Check if CompuTec License Server and CompuTec WMS Server services are up. You can check it in Windows Services - Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services.

## Installed WMS, trial expiring

### <i>**I have purchased a license. How can I obtain the license file?**</i>

You should create an issue on the CompuTec WMS Support page on support.computec to get the license you purchased [here](https://support.computec.pl/projects/SWMS/welcome-guide). Providing accurate information to CompuTec Support will shorten the response time; thus, please check what data are required – check [here](../administrator-guide/installation/wms-licensing.md).

## No bins defined in warehouses

### <i>**Will CompuTec WMS still operate properly?**</i>

Yes. CompuTec WMS can operate on bins in the warehouse. However, defining bins is not required for the proper work of the application.

## Illegal value error on document creation

### <i>**How do I fix it?**</i>

One reason may be a lack of Item Details defined for a specific Item Master Data. Perform the Restore Item Details procedure to fix it. Click [here](../administrator-guide/installation/sap-business-one-settings/item-details-restore.md) to find out more.

## WMS database not installed

### <i>**Ensure all prerequisites are met**</i>

CompuTec WMS User Define Objects are not installed on a specific SAP Business One database. To fix it, please install UDOs. You can check how to do this [here](../administrator-guide/installation/wms-server/overview.md#computec-wms-server-automatic-restart).

## Configuration file not found

### <i>**Please use the settings window for communication**</i>

You probably just installed the application, which is still not set up. Please check [this link](../administrator-guide/installation/wms-server/overview.md) to find out more.

## Checked FAQ and docs, WMS still not working

### <i>**What should I do?**</i>

You should request CompuTec Support assistance by posting an issue within the Support WMS space at [support.computec.pl](https://support.computec.pl/projects/SWMS/welcome-guide). To shorten the problem-solving time needed by CompuTec consultants, you should follow the rules for creating an issue you can find [here](../administrator-guide/issue-reporting/overview.md).

## Complete data is not displayed

>**Note**: This behaviour is not seen in the new WMS User Interface

## Cannot Install CompuTec WMS objects to a database

On an attempt to install CompuTec WMS objects to a database (you can check how to do this [here](../administrator-guide/installation/wms-server/overview.md#computec-wms-server-automatic-restart)), you get the following system message:

:::info
    The installation requires a manually created procedure in the database.

    Please copy the query and execute it in SAP Hana Studio before continuing.
:::

![Alert](./media/Alert.webp)

This system message appears upon attempts to install the CompuTec WMS object on a new database in the HANA version.

### Fix

1. Click 'Copy to Clipboard' on the system message form.
2. Run SAP HANA STUDIO.
3. Choose a required database, then 'Open SQL Console.'
4. Paste the previously copied text and save the configuration.
5. Retry to Install CompuTec WMS objects (check here how to do this).

## Error installing CompuTec WMS objects

### <i>**Please check the logs for details**</i>

### Prerequisites

A CompuTec WMS installation on a “fresh” database (without previous CompuTec WMS installation).

### Reproduction

1. Try to open Custom Configuration.
2. A system message: Error. Please install CompuTec WMS objects first.
3. Try to install CompuTec WMS error.
4. Error message: Error when installing CompuTec WMS objects. Please check the logs for details.

### Fix

Restart the server or try to install the CompuTec WMS objects again.

## CompuTec ProcessForce Database Version not supported

### <i>**Update Database or Reinstall API.Setup**</i>

### Cause

CompuTec ProcessForce version installed on the database differs from the CompuTec ProcessForce API version.

### Fix

You can either:

- install CompuTec ProcessForce API to the correct version
- install CompuTec ProcessForce in the same version as API.

For the mentioned installers, check the [Download](/docs/processforce/releases/download) page.

## System.Exception: Error: Internal error (-10) occurred

If this error occurs in a log file in this location: C:\ProgramData\CompuTec\ServiceManager\Logs, it is required to register the following objects in a related database manually:

- CT_WMS_OCCT
- CT_WMS_OVDA
- CT_WMS_OWTT

Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1PYy9W3P3M) to check how to do this.

## The info icon does not work

On all transactions where you can choose an Item managed by Batches or Serial Numbers, an Info icon leads to additional Batch/Serial Numbers information. In some cases, nothing happens when you click it, and no system message is displayed. In cases like this, check if there is any User Defined Field configured for Batch/Serial Number Object (the button is not responsive when there are no UDFs defined).

## WMS Server Installation Error

### Reproduction

An error occurs during the installation of the CompuTec WMS Server:

![Error](./media/screenshot-1.webp)

### Fix

The error has been fixed in the 2.10.9 version.

In previous versions, please download this file, unpack it, and place (the whole folder) in the following directory: C:\ProgramData.

## Install SAP HANA ODBC Driver / ODBC 13 for SQL Server first

### Reproduction

Click "Save" or "Refresh" on CompuTec WMS Server Settings

### Fix

After pressing "Save" or "Refresh" on CompuTec WMS Server Settings, it is checked whether SAP Business One DI API and ODBC Driver - respective to the selected server type, are installed.

| ODBC Driver Required | Download Link |
| --- | ---|
| ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server | [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121020](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121020) |

A proper Exception/Error is shown in the ServiceManager Log when one of the above drivers is missing.

## Motorola MC65 issue: scanning with RDP and DataWedge

### Example

1. In DataWedge Demo, the code is scanned correctly.
2. With an RDP connection and scanning to a notepad, a part of a code is removed. Originally: (10)**21055**(95)1(95)C00312, actually scanned: (10)**21**(95)1(95)C00312. Part of a GS1 code is missed.

### Solution

**Please note that the Motorola MC65 device is no longer supported by its producer**. However, Motorola support suggested (as best effort only) using Interchar Delay (DataWedge option) to slow down RDP data sending to a host.
