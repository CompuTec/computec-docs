# Log file locations of CompuTec WMS Components

To help diagnose and resolve issues effectively, CompuTec WMS generates log files for its various components. These logs contain detailed records of application activity and errors. When reporting a problem to CompuTec Support, it's helpful to include the relevant log files based on the component involved.

The table below lists the default file paths for each componentâ€™s logs:
