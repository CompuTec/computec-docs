## Explanation: Why These Details Matter

CompuTec Support uses your version, logs, and issue description to:

- Reproduce the error under the same conditions
- Isolate root causes (e.g., hardware delays, network, misconfigurations)
- Prioritize fixes and responses

Without these specifics, support teams may need to follow up for clarification â€” slowing down your resolution.

## Best Practices

- Always attach the **log file** from the **day the issue occurred**.
- Include exact **time stamps** when possible.
- Use clear and concise language.
- If the issue affects only **certain users or devices**, mention it.
