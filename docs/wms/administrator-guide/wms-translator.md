# WMS Translator

This guide explains how to use the WMS Translator, an essential IT solution for businesses utilizing CompuTec WMS. The tool enables users to easily translate the default language of CompuTec WMS (American English) into any other language, making the system more accessible to non-English-speaking users. It is particularly useful for international organizations or businesses that need to customize the interface for different regions or languages. Whether you're translating for a specific locale or testing a new language version, WMS Translator offers an intuitive and efficient process.

:::caution
    If you have created a translation for a specific language, itâ€™s advisable to send these files to CompuTec to be incorporated into the next installer release. Otherwise, the language will revert to the default (American English) after a system upgrade, and your changes will be lost.

Use the switch at the top of the window to access WMS Client and Server translation.

Choose the language which you want to translate (Select language). After that, you can also browse the chosen language version by specific text. Click Load data to load the desired language.

When you implement changes, you can send them to the server (by clicking Save Changes). They will be stored there and added to the following official CompuTec WMS release.

The default language is a source. You cannot change it.

## Translation Download

If you want to test the translation before an official release, you can download the translation files for the selected language. You can then update your CompuTec WMS installation with the downloaded files. Keep in mind that once you upgrade to an official release, the translation files will be overwritten with the latest version.

To swap downloaded language files with the ones in your WMS Server and Client installation folders, copy the translation files to both the WMS Server and WMS Client installation folders.
