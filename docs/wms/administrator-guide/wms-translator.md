# CompuTec WMS Translator

This guide explains how to use the CompuTec WMS Translator, an essential IT solution for businesses utilizing CompuTec WMS. The tool enables users to easily translate the default language of CompuTec WMS (American English) into any other language, making the system more accessible to non-English-speaking users. It is particularly useful for international organizations or businesses that need to customize the interface for different regions or languages. Whether you're translating for a specific locale or testing a new language version, CompuTec WMS Translator offers an intuitive and efficient process.

:::caution
    If you have created a translation for a specific language, itâ€™s advisable to send these files to CompuTec to be incorporated into the next installer release. Otherwise, the language will revert to the default (American English) after a system upgrade, and your changes will be lost.
