:::

- **Recommended Devices**:

While CompuTec WMS is compatible with a broad variety of devices, our experience from numerous implementations has led us to develop a trusted device-system combination that we commonly recommend to our partners and customers. Based on extensive field experience and successful implementations, we highly recommend the Zebra MC92xx terminals, running Windows Embedded Compact 7. This model is fully supported, and users can later upgrade it to Android OS once support for that platform is available.

You can find this information on their website: [MC92xx](https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra_new_ia/en-us/solutions-verticals/product/Mobile_Computers/Hand-Held%20Computers/MC9200%20Mobile%20Computer/fact-sheet/mc9200-os-upgrade-fact-sheet-en-0815.pdf). It is important to purchase the Zebra MC92xx model in the **Premium** version to ensure full compatibility with CompuTec WMS.
