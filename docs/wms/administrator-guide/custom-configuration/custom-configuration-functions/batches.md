# Batches

![Batches](./media/batches.webp)

**Enable Batch Status change on Batch Info** â€“ checking this option adds the Status field (with a drop-down list) to the Batch Details / UDF form on the Batch/Serial Info workflow. Unchecking the option removes the field and prevents changing the Batch status from the application. **This option is available only for a database with ProcessForce installed**.

**Extra field in Batch/Serial Info query equivalent**

Open Custom Query Manager, choose Batch/Serial Info from the list.

Otwieramy Custom Query Manager, wybieramy z listy Batch/Serial Info. In this example we operate on the following two fields:
    1. BatchInfoDetailsList
    2. SerialInfoDetailsList

    ![Batch Info Detail List](./media/batches/batch-serial-info-01.png)

    1. BatchInfoDetailsList

    There are no additional fields here, but we can add columns that are going to be find based on a specific query put in SQL Manager:
        ![Batch Info Details List](./media/batches/batch-info.png)
        ![Batch Info Details List](./media/batches/batch-info-01.png)

    2. SerialInfoDetailsList

    The same situation as in the example above, but this time choose columns from OSRN table:
